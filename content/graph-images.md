Recently, the Water Data for the Nation (WDFN) development [released a new real-time site page](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/blog/wdfn-tng/). One of the[ most common pieces of feedback](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/blog/wdfn-firstlook/)[ ](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/blog/wdfn-firstlook/)that we received about the hydrograph on[ the new monitoring location pages](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/monitoring-location/09380000/) was that users need a way to save an image of a given hydrograph. In the [classic pages](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/uv?site_no=09380000)[,](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/uv?site_no=09380000) these graphs are already images, generated by the server using a command line tool called [gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/). It was easy enough to expose the endpoint that generated those images:

However, the new graphs are not easy to generate, as they are dynamically generated in the web browser using a tool called D3. Replicating the environment of a browser was a non-trivial task, but with the major advances in automated browser testing with tools like [puppeteer](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/puppeteer/), we were able to generate a reasonable solution.

The graph image project is a work in progress and this is a first step to meeting usersâ€™ requests for easy image downloads.
